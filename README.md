# Lab01 ‚Äì Regression Models Evaluation

This assignment focuses on the implementation and evaluation of multiple regression models using Python and scikit-learn. The main objective is to compare different regression approaches on a synthetically generated dataset, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses‚Äîparticularly regarding model complexity, overfitting, and generalization ability.

---

## Implemented Models

- **Linear Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**  
- **Polynomial Regression**

---

## Project Structure

All models are encapsulated in a reusable class called `Regressions`, which provides the following key functionalities:

- **Data Handling**  
  Loads the dataset (`dane_do_regresji.csv`) and splits it into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.

- **Model Training**  
  Provides methods to initialize, train, and evaluate models:
  - `linear_model()`
  - `knn_model()`
  - `poly_model()`

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Computes Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and test sets to evaluate model performance and detect potential overfitting.

- **Model Management**  
  Stores trained models and their configurations in a list, allowing for easy access, export, or reuse.
